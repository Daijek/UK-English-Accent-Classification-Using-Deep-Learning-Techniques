# UK-English-Accent-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
## Overview
<p>
  Research to determine if some unexplored models can produce state-of-the-art results in classifying accents in the UK.
</p>
<h2>Key Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Carried out a comparative analysis to determine the best performing models between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and basic Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in accent classification. </li>
  <li>Developed a state-of-the-art deep learning model that accurately classifies six distinct accents in the UK. </li>
  <li>Explored and validated the transfer learning capabilities of the developed model, enabling its adaptability for diverse research projects with constrained data. </li>
  <li>Conducted comprehensive assessments on the performance of audio pretrained models such as VGGish and Yamnet in the context of accent classification. </li>
  <li>Determined that Convolutional Neural Networks trained on MFCC features, and LSTMs trained on features extracted from the VGGish audio feature extraction model (VGGish - LSTM) produced a state-of-the-art result in classifying accents in the UK with accuracies of 95.10% and 86.65% respectively, F1-scores 94.18% and 86.38% respectively recalls of 96.78 and 87.70%, and precisions 92.05% and 85.70% respectively.</li>
